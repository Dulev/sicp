a) Partial tree recursively creates a tree from a list using this 
recursive relation:

A partial tree is a tree with a root node the most central element of a
list and subtrees, such that the left subtree is a partial tree of all
the elements on the left of the central element of the list and the 
right subtree is a tree of all the elements on the right of the central
element on the list.

Here is the tree produced from the list - '(1 3 5 7 9 11):
             5
           /   \ 
          /     \
         /       \
        /         \
       /           9
      1           /  \
     / \         /    \
  '()   3       7      11
       / \     / \     / \
     '() '() '() '() '() '()

b) The order of growth in the number of steps required by list->tree
to convert a list of n elements is Î˜(n).
